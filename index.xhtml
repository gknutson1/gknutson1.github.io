        <p>I am a student at Eastern Wasnington University, currently studying for a degree in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>When I am not programming, I am often listening to my vinyl records, or playing video games.</p>
        <p>My focus lies in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Database development</li>
            <li>API design and use</li>
            <li>Self-hosting and (Linux) server management</li>

        </h2>
        <p>Here are a couple of my favorite projects that I have worked on:</p>
        <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/gknutson1/ewu-mc">ewu-mc</a></h3>
        <img class="projects" src="img/ewu-mc.png" alt="ewu-mc image"/>
        <p>
            This project was originally built for the Association for Computing Machinery club at
            Eastern Washington University. It's a modification of the Nomifactory modpack, re-themed
            and modified with some new mods and with some balance changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally, I was manually patching the modpack every time Nomifactory update. However,
            I eventually re-wrote it as a series of Python and Bash scripts to automatically apply
            my patches.
        </p>
        <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/gknutson1/SpotList-web-legacy">SpotList</a></h3>
        <img class="projects" src="img/spotlist.png" alt="SpotList image"/>
        <p>
            Built as a group project for a software design class, SpotList integrated with the Spotify API,
            to create playlists. In Spotify, there is no way to simply play all of an artist's songs.
            You can only play individual albums, algorithmically generated lists of the artist's most
            popular songs, or curated artist playlists.
        </p>
        <p>
            SpotList was built to fix this, by allowing the user to create playlists by defining rules
            that add or remove songs from a playlist. SpotList processes every rule in a ruleset, compiles them into
            a list of songs, and injects those songs into a Spotify playlist.
        </p>
        <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/CSCD488-Winter2024/Bill-Organizer">BillOrganizer</a></h3>
        <img class="projects" src="img/billorg.png" alt="Bill Organizer screenshot"/>
        <p>
            This was a project developed for my senior project at Eastern Washington University.
            It downloads and stores bills from the Washington state legislature, and presents it
            in a convenient fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            BillOrganizer allows users to write notes on bills, organize bills into saved lists,
            sort, and filter bills.
